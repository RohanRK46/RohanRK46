Hey there! 👋🏼

I am Rohan Kumar Yadav. I am a passionate Full Stack Developer who specializes in building scalable web applications and websites using the MERN stack.

I design and build whatever I can imagine. If an idea pops into my head, chances are I will build it and ship it.

My main tech stack is JavaScript, React, CSS, and HTML. Along with these languages, I am currently learning TypeScript and can also work with Angular.

I love making unique and stylish web apps and websites. My favorite thing is applying smooth scrolling with parallax effects in a web app.

I do not just build websites — I craft digital experiences that feel smooth, alive, and memorable. 👾🚫
